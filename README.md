# Audio-Emotions
A Deep Learning Model to define emotions behind people voices. using Conveloutin network to extract features from spectrogram with accuracy of 71%.
Tried several Neural Network architecture including using the functional API of TensorFlow and the best results were found using two layers of convolution network with 100 neurons each.
Difinitly will try feature engineering it later.
Noting that after listening to a random samples, it doesn't look like it was labeled correctly for a small portion of the data.
