# Audio-Emotions
A Convolution Network  Model to detect emotions behind people voices. using Conveloutin network to extract features from spectrogram with accuracy of 71%.
Tried several Neural Network architecture including using the functional API "TensorFlow" and the best results were found using a Sequential model of two convolution layers with 100 neurons each.
Difinitly will try feature engineering it later.
Noting that after listening to a random samples, it doesn't look like it was labeled correctly for a small portion of the data.
